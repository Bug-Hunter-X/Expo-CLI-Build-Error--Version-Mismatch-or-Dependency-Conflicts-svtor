# Expo CLI Build Error: Version Mismatch or Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common Expo CLI build error caused by version mismatches between the Expo CLI, the project's SDK version, or dependency conflicts. The `expoBug.js` file shows a sample project structure that might cause this error (though the error itself is simulated as it depends on the exact project setup).  `expoBugSolution.js` provides solutions for troubleshooting and resolving the issue.

**Problem:**

The Expo CLI build process fails due to inconsistencies between the project's dependencies and the Expo environment.

**Solutions:**

* **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Expo CLI by running `npm install -g expo-cli`.
* **Check SDK Version:** Verify that the SDK version in your `app.json` or `expo.json` is compatible with your Expo CLI and other dependencies. Refer to Expo's documentation for compatible SDK versions.
* **Review Dependencies:** Examine your `package.json` for any conflicting or outdated packages. Try updating them using `npm update` or `npm install <package_name>`.  Pay close attention to packages related to native modules or platform-specific code.
* **Clear Cache:** Sometimes, cached files can cause build issues. Try clearing the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean`.
* **EAS Build Configuration:** If you're using EAS Build, ensure your build configuration is correct and compatible with your project setup. Check your `.eas.json` file for any errors.
