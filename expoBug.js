This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the project's SDK version or when dependencies are incorrectly configured. It can manifest as errors during the build process, preventing the app from running on a simulator or physical device.  The error message itself might vary, but it often points to a problem with the package.json or EAS build configuration.
